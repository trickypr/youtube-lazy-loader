# Youtube Lazy Loader

A tiny, fast lazy loader specificity for youtube videos. YouTube can add a
significant amount of time to site load times. For example, they use `764KiB` of
bandwidth. For our site, that is equivalent to around 1.8 seconds, which is
significant. The goal of this script is to provide lazy loader that is tiny,
fast and easy to use.
